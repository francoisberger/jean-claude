# Overview

This folder contains resources for Jean-Claude. In particular:

- wordlist: lists of words used to learn a given language (i.e. with no meaning nor context).

In the future, it is intended to have:

- books: as the name subjects, real language with meaning and grammar to learn how to speak.
- dictionaries: list of words with definition to get understanding of the text.
